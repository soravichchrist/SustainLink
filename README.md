# SustainLink

SustainLink is a visionary project designed to combat waste and enhance community welfare by connecting individuals in need with stores holding near-expiry perishable products. This inclusive platform goes beyond food items, encompassing a wide range of perishable goods. By efficiently tracking expiration dates and fostering real-time connections, SustainLink aims to create a collaborative ecosystem where surplus essentials find purpose, benefitting both businesses and communities. Products can be either donated or bought as per needs of the supplier and buyer
